# To-Do List App

This is a simple to-do list app that allows you to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js with Express for the backend. Data is persisted in a JSON file, so tasks are saved even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

## How to run the app

1. Install Node.js and npm on your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
4. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
5. Run `node server.js` to start the server.
6. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
